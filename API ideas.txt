Possible API design:

Ideally, all of these would have an access_token parameter, and the DB would support multiple people. But that's a future problem.

GET /collection/{set}?[filter=<filter>]  -- Can support multiple filters
GET /collection/{set}/{card}
POST /collection/{set}/{card} -- Only allows updating the CTCs

<filter> = (color:<colorDef>)|(count:<countDef>)|(rarity:<rarityDef>)
<colorDef> = <wWuUbBrRgGxX>+
<countDef> = (<=|>=|=|<|>)\d+
<rarityDef> = <cCuUrRmMm>+
