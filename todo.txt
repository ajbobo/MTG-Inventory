--- General ---
Can I update the database to have fewer documents?
    Would that reduce the number of reads/writes against the quota?
    Maybe a document for each set, which has an array of cards

collector_number from Deckbox and from Scryfall don't match for old sets
    I fixed this in my spreadsheet, but I'll have to do something about it here, too


--- Term ---
Add filters:
    Type
    CTC attributes (Foil, Prerelease, etc)
    Name
Create Docker image where it can run?
    Can I host that image on Heroku, and log into it via SSH (or some other way)?
Add a view (column or cardPanel) that shows the Scryfall price
Add a way to open the card image? (Probably in a separate app, but if I can imbed it, that would be cool)


--- Web UI ---
Should I change EditCTC into a React object instead of a group of functions?
Add filters for Foil, Prerelease, etc.
Add filters for card type
Include column for card type
Card panel doesn't scroll when 2 sides are shown and they overflow the bottom of the window
Add a panel of set information
    Number of cards in the set
    Cards collected
    Percentage collected
    Adjust values based on current filters
