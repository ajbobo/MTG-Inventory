Each card should only appear in the DB once
    Foil and Prerelease should be counts, not booleans
    Count should be an object?
        Count: {"std": 2, "foil": 1, "prerelease": 1}
    The upload program will need to be changed to write this new format

Can I update the database to have fewer documents?
    Would that reduce the number of reads/writes against the quota?
    Maybe a document for each set, which has an array of cards

Apparently, there's a way to cache Firebase results - Can I use that to reduce calls to the API?

collector_number from Deckbox and from Scryfall don't match for old sets
    I fixed this in my spreadsheet, but I'll have to do something about it here, too
