--- General ---
Rename "foil | prerelease" and "foil" in Angular, and DB to be capitalized

--- API ---

--- Angular App ---
Highlight text in search box when it receives focus
Add user authentication

--- Term ---
Add option to ChooseSetDialog to only show sets that are in User_Inv
    This will need to get the list of Documents in User_Inv
Can FilterSettings be changed so that adding new types of filters is easier?
Add filters:
    Price ($1+, $5+, $20+)
    CTC attributes (Foil, Prerelease, etc)
    Type
    Name
Add a way to save decks
    Should also import them from the DeckBox files
Add a way to open the card image? (Probably in a separate app, but if I can imbed it, that would be cool)
Published build needs an icon

--- Misc ---
I added basic deck storage to the API, and then a simple UI to ng-web-ui (see "decks" branch)
  I don't think I need it. I've never gone back to look up the decks I've stored.
