Mana_Cost isn't populated for double-sided cards (VOW #198 - "Dormant Grove // Gnarled Grovestrider")
Replace filters with SQL queries
Add filters:
    Type
    CTC attributes (Foil, Prerelease, etc)
    Name
Add a view (column or cardPanel) that shows the Scryfall price
Add a way to open the card image? (Probably in a separate app, but if I can imbed it, that would be cool)
Add Cancel button to Choose Set dialog


--- Web UI ---
Should I change EditCTC into a React object instead of a group of functions?
Add filters for Foil, Prerelease, etc.
Add filters for card type
Include column for card type
Card panel doesn't scroll when 2 sides are shown and they overflow the bottom of the window
Add a panel of set information
    Number of cards in the set
    Cards collected
    Percentage collected
    Adjust values based on current filters


--- General ---
collectorNumber from Deckbox and from Scryfall don't match for old sets
    I fixed this in my spreadsheet, but I'll have to do something about it here, too


--- New Web UI ---
Migrate from Bootstrap to TailwindCSS and HeadlessUI?

Can I create an API (hosted in Firebase) that does all the real work?
    Firebase Functions requires a paid account, so I'd need to find another way. Heroku? Hosted web-app? Microsft Azure has a free tier that includes Azure Functions
    Then I could create a UI or commandline app that drives it
