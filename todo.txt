--- Windows App ---
Create a standalone app using a UI framework like Avalonia UI?
    Something that can generate an Android app would be cool
If the data and ui can be uncoupled, this might be easier

--- Term ---
Use DecoratedCount when updating the list after editing CTCs
Add option to ChooseSetDialog to only show sets that are in User_Inv
    This will need to get the list of Documents in User_Inv
Can FilterSettings be changed so that adding new types of filters is easier?
Add filters:
    Price ($1+, $5+, $20+)
    CTC attributes (Foil, Prerelease, etc)
    Type
    Name
Add a way to save decks
    Should also import them from the DeckBox files
Add a way to open the card image? (Probably in a separate app, but if I can imbed it, that would be cool)
Published build needs an icon


--- Web UI ---
Should I change EditCTC into a React object instead of a group of functions?
Add filters for Foil, Prerelease, etc.
Add filters for card type
Include column for card type
Card panel doesn't scroll when 2 sides are shown and they overflow the bottom of the window
Add a panel of set information
    Number of cards in the set
    Cards collected
    Percentage collected
    Adjust values based on current filters
