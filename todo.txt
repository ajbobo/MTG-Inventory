--- SOLID refactor ---

   I'm not 100% sold on all of this, but some of it would be worthwhile

Add unit tests -- I think this is the most useful thing I can do, some of the SOLID principles make this easier/possible
Unit tests should create an in-memory DB, and then use the ".read CreateTestDB.sql" to populate it so that tests have clean, real data

--- General ---
Split UI logic from actual behavior?
    Maybe each Dialog needs a Dialog class and a Data/Behavior class
Restructure files based on Model/View/Controller?

--- Windows App ---
Create a standalone app using a UI framework like Avalonia UI?
    Something that can generate an Android app would be cool
If the data and ui can be uncoupled, this might be easier

--- Term ---
Add option to ChooseSetDialog to only show sets that are in User_Inv
    This will need to get the list of Documents in User_Inv
Can FilterSettings be changed so that adding new types of filters is easier?
Add filters:
    Price ($1+, $5+, $20+)
    CTC attributes (Foil, Prerelease, etc)
    Type
    Name
Add a way to save decks
    Should also import them from the DeckBox files
Add a way to open the card image? (Probably in a separate app, but if I can imbed it, that would be cool)
Published build needs an icon
Published build needs Google Firebase creds
Is there a way to protect/hide app.config in release builds?

--- Web UI ---
Should I change EditCTC into a React object instead of a group of functions?
Add filters for Foil, Prerelease, etc.
Add filters for card type
Include column for card type
Card panel doesn't scroll when 2 sides are shown and they overflow the bottom of the window
Add a panel of set information
    Number of cards in the set
    Cards collected
    Percentage collected
    Adjust values based on current filters


--- New Web UI ---
Migrate from Bootstrap to TailwindCSS and HeadlessUI?
    https://tailwindcss.com/
    https://headlessui.dev/

--- V2.0 ---
Can I create an API (hosted in Firebase) that does all the real work?
    Firebase Functions requires a paid account, so I'd need to find another way. Heroku? Hosted web-app? Microsft Azure has a free tier that includes Azure Functions
    Then I could create a UI or commandline app that drives it
