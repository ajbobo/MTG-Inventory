Can I update the database to have fewer documents?
    Would that reduce the number of reads/writes against the quota?
    Maybe a document for each set, which has an array of cards

collector_number from Deckbox and from Scryfall don't match for old sets
    I fixed this in my spreadsheet, but I'll have to do something about it here, too
