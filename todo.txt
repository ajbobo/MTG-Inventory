--- General ---
Rename "foil | prerelease" and "foil" in Angular, Maui App, and DB to be capitalized

--- API ---

--- Angular App ---
Add routing to URL (ie: <app>/{setCode} and <app>/{SetCode}/{Card})

--- Maui App ---
Selecting a card in the list with the keyboard and pressing Enter or Space should open the card's CTC page - I can't find a way to do this in MAUI

--- Term ---
Add option to ChooseSetDialog to only show sets that are in User_Inv
    This will need to get the list of Documents in User_Inv
Can FilterSettings be changed so that adding new types of filters is easier?
Add filters:
    Price ($1+, $5+, $20+)
    CTC attributes (Foil, Prerelease, etc)
    Type
    Name
Add a way to save decks
    Should also import them from the DeckBox files
Add a way to open the card image? (Probably in a separate app, but if I can imbed it, that would be cool)
Published build needs an icon
