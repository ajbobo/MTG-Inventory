--- General ---
Rename "foil | prerelease" and "foil" in Angular, and DB to be capitalized

--- API ---

--- Angular App ---
Add user authentication
Replace isDirty events with a service
Add Spinners where appropriate (loading set names, loading card list, etc.) - https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/spinners/#border-spinner
Replace Bootstrap UI components with Angular Material UI (https://material.angular.io/)? 
    Replace Input
    X Replace Buttons
    Use Menu or Select instead of DropDown
    Use Expansion Panel instead of CardRow - Probably want to lazy-load the internal controls since there are so many rows


--- Term ---
Add option to ChooseSetDialog to only show sets that are in User_Inv
    This will need to get the list of Documents in User_Inv
Can FilterSettings be changed so that adding new types of filters is easier?
Add filters:
    Price ($1+, $5+, $20+)
    CTC attributes (Foil, Prerelease, etc)
    Type
    Name
Add a way to open the card image? (Probably in a separate app, but if I can imbed it, that would be cool)
Published build needs an icon

--- Misc ---
I added basic deck storage to the API, and then a simple UI to ng-web-ui (see "decks" branch)
  I don't think I need it. I've never gone back to look up the decks I've stored.
